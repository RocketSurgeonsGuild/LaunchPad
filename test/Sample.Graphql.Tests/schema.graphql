"Represents a time zone - a mapping between UTC and local time.\nA time zone maps UTC instants to local times - or, equivalently, to the offset from UTC at any particular instant."
scalar DateTimeZone

"Represents a fixed (and calendar-independent) length of time."
scalar Duration

"Represents an instant on the global timeline, with nanosecond resolution."
scalar Instant

"Equates the days of the week with their numerical value according to ISO-8601.\n Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, Wednesday = 3, Thursday = 4, Friday = 5, Saturday = 6, Sunday = 7."

scalar LocalTime

"A local date and time in a particular calendar system, combined with an offset from UTC."
scalar OffsetDateTime

"A combination of a LocalDate and an Offset, to represent a date at a specific offset from UTC but without any time-of-day information."
scalar OffsetDate

"A combination of a LocalTime and an Offset, to represent a time-of-day at a specific offset from UTC but without any date information."
scalar OffsetTime

"An offset from UTC in seconds. A positive value means that the local time is ahead of UTC (e.g. for Europe); a negative value means that the local time is behind UTC (e.g. for America)."
scalar Offset

"Represents a period of time expressed in human chronological terms: hours, days, weeks, months and so on."
